# Source code folder

All re-usable source code for the project goes here.

The source folder is structured as follows:

```
src
├── __init__.py    <- Makes src a Python module
│
├── constants.py   <- Includes project wide constants for easy imports
│
├── data           <- Scripts related to download or generate data
│
└──  models         <- Scripts to train models and then use trained models to make predictions
```

This generic folder structure is useful for most project, but feel free to adapt it to your needs.
